# Intermediate C++: Lambda Expressions

Lambda Expressions are just a shorthand way of passing functors around.
With functors, you must define the class, create an object, and then use that object.
With Lambda Expressions, the object is defined as it is initialized, which can make your code easier to read.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
